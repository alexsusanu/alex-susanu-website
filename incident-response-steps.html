Increase timeout values: Change payment API timeout from 30s to 60s in config
Reduce retry attempts: Change from 5 retries to 2 to reduce load
Disable non-essential features: Turn off recommendation engine during payment
Change batch sizes: Process payments in smaller groups to reduce DB load

Be specific: "Database locks on payment_transactions table" not "database slow"
Provide context: Business impact, affected users, revenue loss
Include evidence: Error messages, screenshots, log snippets
Suggest urgency: "SEV1 - $50k/hour revenue impact"
Offer to help: "I can provide more logs or test fixes"
Set timeline: "Need response in 15 minutes for SEV1"

Document everything: Keep timeline of who you escalated to and when</div>
