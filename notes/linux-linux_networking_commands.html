                <h2>Linux Networking Commands Guide</h2>
<strong>Category:</strong> Networking & System Administration  
<strong>Tags:</strong> linux, networking, tcp-ip, dns, routing, firewall, diagnostics
<h3>Essential Networking Commands</h3>
<strong>What this guide covers:</strong> Comprehensive reference for Linux network configuration, diagnostics, monitoring, and troubleshooting commands used in daily network operations.
<strong>Why master networking commands:</strong> Network issues are among the most common problems in IT infrastructure. These commands help diagnose connectivity problems, configure network interfaces, monitor traffic, and secure network communications.
<h3>Network Configuration Commands</h3>
<h4><strong>ip command</strong> - Modern network configuration tool</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> The <code>ip</code> command is a powerful networking tool that replaces several older commands (ifconfig, route, arp). It manages network interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables, and network namespaces.
<strong>Why use it:</strong> Modern Linux distributions prefer <code>ip</code> because it's more feature-complete, faster, and actively maintained. It supports advanced networking features like VLANs, bridges, and network namespaces.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Network configuration, troubleshooting connectivity issues, setting up routing, managing multiple IP addresses on interfaces.
<pre><code><h2>Display network interfaces and their status</h2>
ip addr show                                  # Shows all interfaces with IP addresses, MAC addresses, and status
ip a                                         # Short form - same as above
ip addr show eth0                            # Shows details for specific interface only
ip -4 addr show                              # Shows only IPv4 addresses (filters out IPv6)
ip -6 addr show                              # Shows only IPv6 addresses
<h2>Why: You need to see what IP addresses are assigned, interface status (up/down), </h2>
<h2>and network configuration before troubleshooting connectivity issues</h2>
<h2>Show physical network interface information</h2>
ip link show                                 # Shows physical interfaces, MAC addresses, MTU, state
ip -s link show eth0                         # Shows statistics: packets sent/received, errors, drops
ip link show up                              # Shows only interfaces that are currently active
<h2>Why: Helps identify hardware issues, check if interface is physically connected,</h2>
<h2>and monitor network performance through statistics</h2></code></pre>
<strong>Configure network interfaces:</strong>
<pre><code><h2>Add and remove IP addresses</h2>
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0  # Assigns IP address with /24 subnet mask to eth0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 brd + dev eth0  # Same as above but calculates broadcast address automatically
sudo ip addr del 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0  # Removes the specified IP address from interface
<h2>Why: Temporary IP configuration for testing, setting up additional IPs on same interface,</h2>
<h2>or fixing network configuration without editing config files</h2>
<h2>Control interface state</h2>
sudo ip link set eth0 up                     # Activates the network interface (equivalent to "ifup")
sudo ip link set eth0 down                   # Deactivates the network interface (equivalent to "ifdown")
sudo ip link set eth0 mtu 1500               # Sets Maximum Transmission Unit (packet size limit)
sudo ip link set eth0 name wan0              # Renames interface from eth0 to wan0
<h2>Why: Restart network interfaces without rebooting, optimize network performance with MTU,</h2>
<h2>organize interfaces with meaningful names</h2></code></pre>
<strong>Routing management:</strong>
<pre><code><h2>View and analyze routing</h2>
ip route show                                # Displays complete routing table showing how packets are forwarded
ip route show default                        # Shows only the default gateway (where unknown traffic goes)
ip route get 8.8.8.8                        # Shows exactly which route will be used to reach specific destination
<h2>Why: Troubleshoot connectivity issues, verify traffic is being routed correctly,</h2>
<h2>understand network path before making changes</h2>
<h2>Modify routing table</h2>
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1  # Adds static route: traffic to 192.168.2.x goes through 192.168.1.1
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1   # Sets default gateway (where all unknown traffic goes)
sudo ip route del 192.168.2.0/24            # Removes specific route from routing table
sudo ip route flush cache                    # Clears cached routing decisions, forces recalculation
<h2>Why: Fix routing problems, set up network segmentation, optimize traffic flow,</h2>
<h2>troubleshoot "destination unreachable" errors</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>ifconfig</strong> - Legacy network interface configuration</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> Traditional Unix command for configuring network interfaces. Shows and modifies network interface parameters like IP addresses, netmasks, and interface status.
<strong>Why still important:</strong> Many older systems, scripts, and documentation use ifconfig. Some network engineers prefer its simpler syntax for basic operations.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Quick interface checks, legacy system administration, when ip command is not available, simple network configuration tasks.
<pre><code><h2>Display interface information</h2>
ifconfig                                     # Shows all active network interfaces with their configuration
ifconfig -a                                  # Shows ALL interfaces including inactive ones (down state)
ifconfig eth0                                # Shows configuration for specific interface only
<h2>Why: Quick overview of network configuration, check if interfaces are up,</h2>
<h2>see assigned IP addresses and network statistics</h2>
<h2>Configure network interfaces</h2>
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0  # Sets IP address and subnet mask
sudo ifconfig eth0 up                        # Brings interface online (starts network connectivity)
sudo ifconfig eth0 down                      # Takes interface offline (stops network connectivity)
sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55  # Changes MAC address (useful for network testing)
<h2>Why: Quick network configuration changes, temporarily assign IP addresses,</h2>
<h2>troubleshoot by changing MAC addresses, prepare interfaces for configuration</h2></code></pre>
<h3>Network Diagnostics Commands</h3>
<h4><strong>ping</strong> - Test network connectivity</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> Sends ICMP echo request packets to test if a remote host is reachable and measures round-trip time. Most fundamental network troubleshooting tool.
<strong>Why essential:</strong> First step in network troubleshooting. Confirms basic connectivity, measures network latency, and can reveal packet loss issues that cause poor performance.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Test internet connectivity, verify network configuration changes, measure network performance, diagnose intermittent connectivity issues.
<pre><code><h2>Basic connectivity testing</h2>
ping google.com                              # Tests if google.com is reachable and measures response time
ping -c 4 192.168.1.1                       # Sends exactly 4 ping packets then stops (useful in scripts)
ping -i 2 192.168.1.1                       # Sends ping every 2 seconds instead of default 1 second
ping -s 1000 192.168.1.1                    # Sends larger packets (1000 bytes) to test MTU issues
<h2>Why: Confirm basic connectivity before complex troubleshooting,</h2>
<h2>test if network changes worked, identify intermittent connection problems</h2>
<h2>Advanced testing</h2>
ping -W 1 192.168.1.1                       # Sets timeout to 1 second (faster failure detection)
ping -t 64 192.168.1.1                      # Sets TTL (Time To Live) - how many hops packet can make
ping6 ipv6.google.com                       # Tests IPv6 connectivity specifically
ping -f 192.168.1.1                         # Flood ping - sends packets as fast as possible (requires root)
<h2>Why: Diagnose specific network problems like MTU issues, IPv6 problems,</h2>
<h2>test network performance under load, troubleshoot routing loops</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>traceroute/tracepath</strong> - Trace network path</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> Shows the complete path packets take through the network to reach a destination, including all intermediate routers and their response times.
<strong>Why crucial:</strong> Identifies exactly where network problems occur. If connectivity fails, traceroute shows whether the problem is with your router, ISP, or destination server.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Troubleshoot slow connections, identify network outages, verify routing changes, diagnose intermittent connectivity issues.
<pre><code><h2>Basic path tracing</h2>
traceroute google.com                        # Shows every router hop between you and google.com with response times
traceroute -n google.com                     # Uses IP addresses only (no DNS lookups) - faster and avoids DNS issues
traceroute -p 80 google.com                 # Uses port 80 instead of ICMP (useful when ICMP is blocked)
<h2>Why: Identify which network segment is causing problems,</h2>
<h2>verify traffic takes expected path, measure latency at each hop</h2>
<h2>Alternative tools</h2>
tracepath google.com                         # Similar to traceroute but doesn't require root privileges
mtr google.com                               # Combines ping and traceroute with continuous monitoring and statistics
<h2>Why: mtr provides ongoing monitoring to catch intermittent issues,</h2>
<h2>tracepath works without special privileges</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>nslookup</strong> - DNS lookup utility</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> Queries DNS servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. Can query specific record types like mail servers, name servers, and text records.
<strong>Why important:</strong> DNS problems are extremely common and cause websites to be unreachable even when the server is working fine. DNS troubleshooting is essential.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Website won't load, email delivery problems, verify DNS configuration changes, troubleshoot domain-related issues.
<pre><code><h2>Basic DNS queries</h2>
nslookup google.com                          # Converts domain name to IP address using default DNS server
nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8                 # Queries specific DNS server (useful to compare different DNS providers)
nslookup -type=MX gmail.com                 # Finds mail servers for domain (troubleshoot email delivery)
nslookup -type=NS google.com                # Finds authoritative name servers for domain
nslookup -type=TXT google.com               # Gets text records (SPF, DKIM, domain verification, etc.)
<h2>Why: Verify DNS is working correctly, troubleshoot email problems,</h2>
<h2>confirm DNS changes have propagated, check domain configuration</h2>
<h2>Reverse DNS lookup</h2>
nslookup 8.8.8.8                            # Finds domain name associated with IP address
<h2>Why: Identify unknown servers, verify reverse DNS setup, troubleshoot email delivery issues</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>dig</strong> - Advanced DNS lookup tool</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> More powerful and flexible DNS query tool than nslookup. Provides detailed information about DNS queries and responses, with better scripting support.
<strong>Why preferred:</strong> More reliable than nslookup, better output format, supports advanced DNS features, preferred by network professionals.

ss -o                                        # Shows timer information for connections
<h2>Why: Filter connections by state or address, monitor specific services,</h2>
<h2>troubleshoot connection timing issues</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>lsof</strong> - List open files and network connections</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> Shows all open files and network connections by processes. Since "everything is a file" in Linux, this includes network sockets, making it excellent for network troubleshooting.
<strong>Why powerful:</strong> Connects network activity to specific processes, helps identify which application is using which port, essential for security analysis.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Identify process using specific port, troubleshoot "port already in use" errors, security investigation, resource usage analysis.
<pre><code><h2>Network-specific usage</h2>
lsof -i                                      # Shows all network connections with associated processes
lsof -i :80                                  # Shows what process is using port 80 (helps with port conflicts)
lsof -i TCP:22                               # Shows TCP connections on port 22 (SSH connections)
lsof -i UDP                                  # Shows all UDP connections
lsof -i @192.168.1.1                        # Shows connections to specific IP address
<h2>Why: Identify which application is causing network issues,</h2>
<h2>resolve port conflicts, monitor application network usage</h2>
<h2>Process and file analysis</h2>
lsof -u username                             # Shows all files opened by specific user
lsof +D /var/log                             # Shows what processes have files open in directory
lsof -p 1234                                 # Shows all files opened by specific process ID
<h2>Why: Troubleshoot file locking issues, identify resource usage by user or process,</h2>
<h2>understand application behavior</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>tcpdump</strong> - Packet capture and analysis</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> Captures and analyzes network packets at the lowest level. Shows exactly what data is being sent and received on network interfaces.
<strong>Why crucial:</strong> Only way to see actual network traffic content, essential for deep troubleshooting, can identify problems that other tools miss.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Complex network problems, security analysis, application debugging, protocol-level troubleshooting, performance analysis.
<pre><code><h2>Basic packet capture</h2>
sudo tcpdump -i eth0                         # Captures all traffic on eth0 interface
sudo tcpdump -i any                          # Captures traffic on all network interfaces
sudo tcpdump host 192.168.1.1               # Captures only traffic to/from specific host
sudo tcpdump port 80                         # Captures only HTTP traffic (port 80)
sudo tcpdump -n port 53                      # Captures DNS traffic without resolving hostnames
<h2>Why: See actual network traffic, identify unexpected connections,</h2>
<h2>troubleshoot application network communication</h2>
<h2>Advanced filtering and analysis</h2>
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp port 22'          # Captures only SSH traffic with TCP filter
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 'src 192.168.1.1'      # Captures traffic from specific source IP
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 'dst port 443'         # Captures HTTPS traffic to any destination
sudo tcpdump -w capture.pcap                # Saves captured packets to file for later analysis
sudo tcpdump -r capture.pcap                # Reads and displays previously captured packets
<h2>Why: Focus on specific traffic types, save evidence for analysis,</h2>
<h2>share packet captures with other team members</h2>
<h2>Detailed packet inspection</h2>
sudo tcpdump -v                              # Verbose output with more packet details
sudo tcpdump -vv                             # Very verbose output with maximum details
sudo tcpdump -X                              # Shows packet contents in both hex and ASCII
sudo tcpdump -A                              # Shows packet contents in ASCII only
<h2>Why: Understand exact packet contents, debug application protocols,</h2>
<h2>identify data corruption or protocol violations</h2></code></pre>
<h3>Network Security Commands</h3>
<h4><strong>iptables</strong> - Linux firewall management</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> Controls the Linux kernel firewall by managing rules that filter network traffic. Can block or allow traffic based on source, destination, port, protocol, and other criteria.
<strong>Why critical:</strong> Primary security tool for Linux servers, controls network access, prevents unauthorized connections, essential for system security.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Secure servers, control network access, block malicious traffic, implement network policies, troubleshoot connectivity issues.
<pre><code><h2>View firewall configuration</h2>
sudo iptables -L                             # Lists all firewall rules in human-readable format
sudo iptables -L -n                          # Lists rules with numeric output (no DNS resolution)
sudo iptables -L -v                          # Verbose output showing packet and byte counters
sudo iptables -S                             # Shows rules in command format (useful for backup/restore)
<h2>Why: Understand current security configuration, verify rules are working,</h2>
<h2>troubleshoot blocked connections</h2>
<h2>Basic firewall rules</h2>
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT     # Allows SSH connections (port 22)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT     # Allows HTTP connections (port 80)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT    # Allows HTTPS connections (port 443)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP               # Drops all other incoming traffic (default deny)
<h2>Why: Secure server by allowing only necessary services,</h2>
<h2>block unauthorized access attempts, implement security policies</h2>
<h2>Advanced filtering</h2>
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT    # Allows traffic from specific network
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT  # Allows return traffic
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT       # Allows local loopback traffic
sudo iptables -D INPUT 1                     # Deletes first rule in INPUT chain
<h2>Why: Implement complex security policies, allow return traffic for outbound connections,</h2>
<h2>maintain necessary system communication</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>ufw</strong> - Uncomplicated Firewall</h4>
<strong>What it does:</strong> Simplified interface for managing iptables rules. Provides easier syntax for common firewall tasks while using iptables underneath.
<strong>Why useful:</strong> Much easier to use than raw iptables, good for basic firewall needs, less error-prone for beginners.
<strong>When to use:</strong> Simple firewall configuration, when you need quick security setup, prefer simplified syntax over complex iptables rules.
<pre><code><h2>Basic ufw operations</h2>
sudo ufw status                              # Shows current firewall status and rules
sudo ufw enable                              # Enables the firewall
sudo ufw disable                             # Disables the firewall
sudo ufw reset                               # Resets firewall to default settings
<h2>Simple rule management</h2>
sudo ufw allow 22                            # Allows SSH (port 22)
sudo ufw allow ssh                           # Same as above using service name
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp                        # Allows HTTP with specific protocol
sudo ufw deny 23                             # Blocks telnet (port 23)
sudo ufw delete allow 80                     # Removes previously created rule
<h2>Why: Quick and safe firewall configuration, less chance of locking yourself out,</h2>
<h2>easier to understand and maintain</h2></code></pre>
<h3>Practical Network Troubleshooting Scenarios</h3>
<h4><strong>Scenario 1: "Website won't load"</strong></h4>
<strong>Step-by-step troubleshooting approach:</strong>
<pre><code><h2>1. Test basic connectivity</h2>
ping google.com                              # Test if internet works at all
<h2>If this fails: check network configuration, cables, ISP issues</h2>
<h2>2. Test specific website</h2>
ping example.com                             # Test if the specific website is reachable
<h2>If this fails but google works: website server problem or DNS issue</h2>
<h2>3. Test DNS resolution</h2>
nslookup example.com                         # Verify domain name resolves to IP address
dig example.com                              # Get detailed DNS information
<h2>If DNS fails: try different DNS server (8.8.8.8), check DNS configuration</h2>
<h2>4. Test specific service</h2>
telnet example.com 80                        # Test if web server is responding
curl -I http://example.com                   # Test HTTP response headers
<h2>If connection fails: server down, firewall blocking, wrong port</h2>
<h2>5. Trace network path</h2>
traceroute example.com                       # Find where connection fails
<h2>Shows exactly which network hop is causing problems</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>Scenario 2: "Server port conflict - service won't start"</strong></h4>
<pre><code><h2>1. Identify what's using the port</h2>
lsof -i :80                                  # Find process using port 80
ss -tulpn | grep :80                         # Alternative method using ss
netstat -tulpn | grep :80                    # Alternative method using netstat
<h2>2. Investigate the conflicting process</h2>
ps aux | grep [process-name]                 # Get details about the process
systemctl status [service-name]             # Check service status
<h2>3. Resolve the conflict</h2>
sudo systemctl stop [conflicting-service]   # Stop the conflicting service
sudo kill -9 [process-id]                   # Force kill if necessary (last resort)
<h2>Then start your desired service</h2>
<h2>4. Prevent future conflicts</h2>
sudo systemctl disable [unwanted-service]   # Prevent service from auto-starting
<h2>Or configure services to use different ports</h2></code></pre>
<h4><strong>Scenario 3: "Slow network performance"</strong></h4>
<pre><code><h2>1. Test basic connectivity and speed</h2>
ping -c 10 8.8.8.8                          # Check latency and packet loss
<h2>Look for high response times or packet loss</h2>
<h2>2. Test bandwidth</h2>
wget -O /dev/null http://speedtest.tele2.net/100MB.zip  # Download speed test
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{speed_download}\n" http://example.com/largefile  # Measure download speed
<h2>3. Check interface statistics</h2>
ip -s link show eth0                         # Look for errors, drops, collisions
cat /proc/net/dev                            # Network interface statistics
<h2>4. Monitor real-time traffic</h2>
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 100                 # Sample network traffic
iftop                                        # Real-time bandwidth usage by connection
nethogs                                      # Network usage by process
<h2>5. Check for network congestion</h2>
ss -i                                        # Check TCP connection details
<h2>Look for retransmissions, congestion window issues</h2></code></pre>
