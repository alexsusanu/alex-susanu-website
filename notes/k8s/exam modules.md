Here are the key modules you should study for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam:

## Core Application Lifecycle Management

- Understanding deployment strategies (rolling updates, blue-green, canary)
- Creating and managing Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods
- Scaling applications up and down
- Managing application rollouts and rollbacks

## Configuration

- Working with ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Environment variables and configuration injection
- Volume mounts for configuration data
- Managing sensitive information securely

## Multi-Container Pods

- Sidecar container patterns
- Init containers and their use cases
- Container communication within pods
- Shared volumes between containers

## Observability

- Implementing health checks (liveness, readiness, startup probes)
- Container logging and log analysis
- Monitoring and debugging applications
- Understanding pod and container metrics

## Pod Design

- Labels and selectors
- Annotations and their proper usage
- Service discovery mechanisms
- Pod networking fundamentals

## Services and Networking

- Creating and configuring Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- Ingress controllers and routing
- Network policies for security
- DNS resolution in Kubernetes

## State Persistence

- Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims
- Storage classes and dynamic provisioning
- StatefulSets for stateful applications
- Data backup and recovery concepts

The exam is entirely hands-on, so focus on practical exercises with kubectl commands and YAML manifests rather than just theory. Practice creating, modifying, and troubleshooting these resources in a real Kubernetes environment.
