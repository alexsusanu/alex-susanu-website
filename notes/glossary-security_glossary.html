<h3>Authentication</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system trying to access a resource.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Authentication is the first line of defense in security. Without proper authentication, anyone could access sensitive systems and data.
<strong>Types:</strong>
<ul><li><strong>Something you know</strong> - Passwords, PINs, security questions</li>
<li><strong>Something you have</strong> - Smart cards, tokens, mobile phones</li>
<li><strong>Something you are</strong> - Biometrics (fingerprints, face recognition)</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> - Combines two or more types</li>
<strong>Common methods:</strong>
<li><strong>Username/Password</strong> - Traditional but weakest form</li>
<li><strong>OAuth</strong> - Third-party authentication (Login with Google/Facebook)</li>
<li><strong>SAML</strong> - Enterprise single sign-on standard</li>
<li><strong>JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</strong> - Stateless authentication tokens</li>
<strong>Best practices:</strong>
<li><strong>Strong passwords</strong> - Long, complex, unique</li>
<li><strong>Password managers</strong> - Generate and store secure passwords</li>
<li><strong>MFA everywhere</strong> - Add second factor whenever possible</li>
<li><strong>Regular rotation</strong> - Change passwords periodically</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Every application needs authentication. It's fundamental to security.
<h3>Authorization</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Process of determining what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Authentication tells you who someone is; authorization tells you what they can do. Both are essential for proper access control.
<strong>Authorization models:</strong>
<li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> - Permissions based on user roles</li>
<li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong> - Permissions based on attributes</li>
<li><strong>Access Control Lists (ACL)</strong> - Explicit permissions for each resource</li>
<li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong> - Resource owners control access</li>
<strong>Common patterns:</strong>
<li><strong>Principle of least privilege</strong> - Give minimum necessary permissions</li>
<li><strong>Separation of duties</strong> - Require multiple people for sensitive operations</li>
<li><strong>Time-based access</strong> - Permissions expire after certain time</li>
<li><strong>Location-based access</strong> - Restrict access by geographic location</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Any system with multiple users or different permission levels.
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Process of converting readable data into an unreadable format using algorithms and keys.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Encryption protects data confidentiality. Even if attackers gain access to encrypted data, they can't read it without the decryption key.
<strong>Types:</strong>
<li><strong>Symmetric encryption</strong> - Same key for encryption and decryption (AES)</li>
<li><strong>Asymmetric encryption</strong> - Different keys (public/private key pairs like RSA)</li>
<li><strong>Hashing</strong> - One-way transformation, can't be reversed (SHA-256)</li>
<strong>Common use cases:</strong>
<li><strong>Data at rest</strong> - Encrypt stored files and databases</li>
<li><strong>Data in transit</strong> - Encrypt network communications (HTTPS, TLS)</li>
<li><strong>Application-level</strong> - Encrypt sensitive fields in applications</li>
<li><strong>Full disk encryption</strong> - Protect entire hard drives</li>
<strong>Key management:</strong>
<li><strong>Key rotation</strong> - Regularly change encryption keys</li>
<li><strong>Key storage</strong> - Secure key management systems (HSM, KMS)</li>
<li><strong>Key escrow</strong> - Backup keys for recovery scenarios</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Any time you handle sensitive data. Encryption should be default, not optional.
<h3>SSL/TLS</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over networks, most commonly seen in HTTPS.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> SSL/TLS protects data transmission between clients and servers, preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
<strong>How it works:</strong>
1. <strong>Handshake</strong> - Client and server negotiate encryption methods
2. <strong>Certificate exchange</strong> - Server proves its identity
3. <strong>Key exchange</strong> - Establish shared encryption keys
4. <strong>Secure communication</strong> - All data encrypted with agreed keys
<strong>Certificate types:</strong>
<li><strong>Domain Validation (DV)</strong> - Basic validation, cheapest option</li>
<li><strong>Organization Validation (OV)</strong> - Validates organization identity</li>
<li><strong>Extended Validation (EV)</strong> - Highest validation, shows green bar</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard</strong> - Covers all subdomains (*.example.com)</li>
<strong>Best practices:</strong>
<li><strong>Use TLS 1.2 or higher</strong> - Older versions have vulnerabilities</li>
<li><strong>Strong cipher suites</strong> - Avoid weak encryption algorithms</li>
<li><strong>Certificate monitoring</strong> - Track expiration dates</li>
<li><strong>HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)</strong> - Force HTTPS connections</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Any website or API handling sensitive data. HTTPS is now standard for all websites.
<h3>Firewall</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, blocking malicious traffic while allowing legitimate communication.
<strong>Types:</strong>
<li><strong>Network firewalls</strong> - Hardware devices protecting entire networks</li>
<li><strong>Host-based firewalls</strong> - Software running on individual computers</li>
<li><strong>Application firewalls</strong> - Inspect application-layer traffic (WAF)</li>
<li><strong>Next-generation firewalls</strong> - Combine traditional firewall with additional features</li>
<strong>Firewall rules:</strong>
<li><strong>Allow rules</strong> - Permit specific traffic</li>
<li><strong>Deny rules</strong> - Block specific traffic</li>
<li><strong>Default policy</strong> - What to do with unmatched traffic</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong> - Record firewall decisions for analysis</li>
<strong>Common configurations:</strong>
<li><strong>DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)</strong> - Separate network for public-facing servers</li>
<li><strong>Port blocking</strong> - Close unused network ports</li>
<li><strong>IP whitelisting</strong> - Only allow traffic from approved sources</li>
<li><strong>Geographic blocking</strong> - Block traffic from specific countries</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Every network should have firewall protection. It's a fundamental security control.
<h3>Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing security vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> You can't fix what you don't know is broken. Regular vulnerability assessments help identify security weaknesses before attackers exploit them.
<strong>Types of assessments:</strong>
<li><strong>Network scanning</strong> - Identify open ports and services</li>
<li><strong>Web application scanning</strong> - Find common web vulnerabilities</li>
<li><strong>Database scanning</strong> - Check for database security issues</li>
<li><strong>Wireless scanning</strong> - Assess Wi-Fi security</li>
<strong>Common vulnerabilities:</strong>
<li><strong>SQL injection</strong> - Malicious database queries</li>
<li><strong>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</strong> - Malicious scripts in web pages</li>
<li><strong>Buffer overflow</strong> - Memory corruption attacks</li>
<li><strong>Unpatched software</strong> - Known vulnerabilities in outdated software</li>
<strong>Vulnerability management:</strong>
<li><strong>Regular scanning</strong> - Automated, frequent assessments</li>
<li><strong>Risk prioritization</strong> - Fix critical vulnerabilities first</li>
<li><strong>Patch management</strong> - Keep systems updated</li>
<li><strong>Remediation tracking</strong> - Ensure vulnerabilities are actually fixed</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Regular vulnerability assessments are essential for maintaining security posture.
<h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Authorized simulated cyber attack performed to evaluate system security by attempting to exploit vulnerabilities.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Penetration testing validates that security controls actually work in practice, not just in theory. It identifies real-world attack paths that automated tools might miss.
<strong>Types of pen tests:</strong>
<li><strong>Black box</strong> - No prior knowledge of system (external attacker perspective)</li>
<li><strong>White box</strong> - Full knowledge of system (internal threat perspective)</li>
<li><strong>Gray box</strong> - Partial knowledge (compromise scenario)</li>
<strong>Testing phases:</strong>
1. <strong>Reconnaissance</strong> - Gather information about target
2. <strong>Scanning</strong> - Identify live systems and services
3. <strong>Enumeration</strong> - Extract detailed information
4. <strong>Exploitation</strong> - Attempt to gain unauthorized access
5. <strong>Post-exploitation</strong> - Assess impact and persistence
6. <strong>Reporting</strong> - Document findings and recommendations
<strong>Compliance requirements:</strong>
<li><strong>PCI DSS</strong> - Credit card industry requires annual pen tests</li>
<li><strong>SOX</strong> - Financial companies need security testing</li>
<li><strong>HIPAA</strong> - Healthcare organizations must assess security</li>
<li><strong>ISO 27001</strong> - Information security management standard</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Annual penetration testing is best practice for any organization handling sensitive data.
<h3>Incident Response</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyber attack.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Even with the best security measures, incidents will occur. Having a proper incident response plan minimizes damage and recovery time.
<strong>Incident response phases:</strong>
1. <strong>Preparation</strong> - Develop plans, train team, set up tools
2. <strong>Identification</strong> - Detect and analyze potential incidents
3. <strong>Containment</strong> - Limit the scope and impact of incident
4. <strong>Eradication</strong> - Remove the threat from environment
5. <strong>Recovery</strong> - Restore systems to normal operation
6. <strong>Lessons learned</strong> - Analyze incident and improve processes
<strong>Key roles:</strong>
<li><strong>Incident commander</strong> - Coordinates overall response</li>
<li><strong>Technical analysts</strong> - Investigate and contain threats</li>
<li><strong>Communications lead</strong> - Manage internal/external communications</li>
<li><strong>Legal counsel</strong> - Handle regulatory and legal requirements</li>
<strong>Documentation requirements:</strong>
<li><strong>Incident timeline</strong> - Chronological record of events</li>
<li><strong>Actions taken</strong> - What was done to respond</li>
<li><strong>Evidence preservation</strong> - Maintain chain of custody</li>
<li><strong>Impact assessment</strong> - Quantify damage and costs</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Every organization should have an incident response plan before they need it.
<h3>Zero Trust</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Security model that requires verification for every person and device trying to access resources, regardless of their location.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Traditional security assumed internal networks were safe, but modern threats often come from inside. Zero Trust assumes breach and verifies everything.
<strong>Core principles:</strong>
<li><strong>Never trust, always verify</strong> - Don't assume anything is safe</li>
<li><strong>Least privilege access</strong> - Give minimum necessary permissions</li>
<li><strong>Assume breach</strong> - Design for compromise scenarios</li>
<li><strong>Verify explicitly</strong> - Use all available data points for decisions</li>
<strong>Key components:</strong>
<li><strong>Identity verification</strong> - Strong authentication for all users</li>
<li><strong>Device compliance</strong> - Ensure devices meet security standards</li>
<li><strong>Network segmentation</strong> - Limit lateral movement</li>
<li><strong>Data protection</strong> - Encrypt and classify sensitive information</li>
<strong>Implementation approaches:</strong>
<li><strong>Microsegmentation</strong> - Create small, isolated network zones</li>
<li><strong>Software-defined perimeter</strong> - Dynamic, encrypted connections</li>
<li><strong>Privileged access management</strong> - Control admin access</li>
<li><strong>Continuous monitoring</strong> - Real-time security assessment</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Zero Trust is becoming the standard security model for modern organizations.
<h3>SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Technology that aggregates and analyzes security data from across an organization to detect threats and ensure compliance.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> SIEM provides centralized visibility into security events, enabling faster threat detection and response across complex IT environments.
<strong>Key functions:</strong>
<li><strong>Log aggregation</strong> - Collect data from multiple sources</li>
<li><strong>Event correlation</strong> - Identify patterns that indicate threats</li>
<li><strong>Real-time monitoring</strong> - Continuous security surveillance</li>
<li><strong>Compliance reporting</strong> - Generate audit reports</li>
<li><strong>Incident response</strong> - Coordinate response to security events</li>
<strong>Data sources:</strong>
<li><strong>Network devices</strong> - Firewalls, routers, switches</li>
<li><strong>Security tools</strong> - Antivirus, intrusion detection systems</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Web servers, databases, custom apps</li>
<li><strong>Operating systems</strong> - Windows, Linux, macOS logs</li>

<li><strong>ArcSight</strong> - HP's enterprise SIEM platform</li>
<li><strong>Elastic Security</strong> - Open-source option built on Elasticsearch</li>
<strong>When you'll use it:</strong> Medium to large organizations typically implement SIEM for centralized security monitoring.
<h3>Threat Intelligence</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Evidence-based knowledge about existing or emerging threats that can inform security decisions.
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Understanding the threat landscape helps organizations prioritize security investments and prepare for likely attack scenarios.
<strong>Types of threat intelligence:</strong>
<li><strong>Strategic</strong> - High-level trends and risks for executive decision-making</li>
<li><strong>Tactical</strong> - Attack techniques and procedures for security teams</li>
<li><strong>Operational</strong> - Specific campaigns and threat actor activities</li>
